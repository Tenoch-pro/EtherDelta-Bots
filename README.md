# EtherDelta bot sample code

For API documentation, see https://github.com/etherdelta/etherdelta.github.io/tree/master/docs.

Each language has its own subfolder. In general, each subfolder has two example bots:

* maker -- a bot that places orders on both sides of the market.
* taker -- a bot that trades against the best-available sell order.

# Warning

Please use these at your own risk. ALWAYS test with small amounts first.
